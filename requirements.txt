# 1. Data Acquisition & Storage
## 1.1. Data Update Mechanism
### 1.1.1. Update Execution
- **1.1.1.1.** The System shall allow manual execution of the `update_data()` function, rather than calling it inside `__init__`.
- **1.1.1.2.** The System shall prompt the user to select the desired timeframe before fetching data.
- **1.1.1.3.** The System shall determine which data is missing and request only the necessary updates, avoiding duplication.
- **1.1.1.4.** The System shall update both option and underlying security historical data during the update process.

### 1.1.2. Timeframe Management
- **1.1.2.1.** The System shall fetch both **daily and intraday data**, supporting multiple available timeframes.
- **1.1.2.2.** The System shall handle different time resolutions based on the selected timeframe.
- **1.1.2.3.** The System shall ensure seamless integration of historical intraday and daily data.

## 1.2. File Naming & Storage Structure
### 1.2.1. File Organization
- **1.2.1.1.** The System shall save files using the format `{SYMBOL_TYPE_TF}`, e.g., `SPY_options_1minute`, where `TYPE` can be either `stock`, `index`, or `options`.
- **1.2.1.2.** The System shall store options, implied volatility, open interest, and Greeks in appropriately structured files.
- **1.2.1.3.** The System shall ensure that underlying security data (stock/index) is stored separately from option data.

### 1.2.2. Data Integration & Deduplication
- **1.2.2.1.** The System shall verify existing stored data before fetching new data, ensuring updates do not introduce redundant records.
- **1.2.2.2.** The System shall merge new data efficiently while preserving the integrity of previously stored records.
- **1.2.2.3.** The System shall prevent inconsistencies between option and underlying security data by ensuring synchronized updates.

# 2. Option Market Data Handling
## 2.1. Options & Underlying Data Synchronization
### 2.1.1. Data Alignment
- **2.1.1.1.** The System shall fetch **option market data** while ensuring proper alignment with the **corresponding underlying asset prices**.
- **2.1.1.2.** The System shall ensure that **Greeks, Implied Volatility, and Open Interest** are assigned to the correct option contract row in the dataset.
- **2.1.1.3.** The System shall verify that all options data points match the correct underlying price timestamp.

### 2.1.2. Data Storage per Security Type
- **2.1.2.1.** The System shall store **option data** separately from **underlying asset data**.
- **2.1.2.2.** The System shall organize stored data based on the timeframe, security type, and date range.
- **2.1.2.3.** The System shall allow efficient retrieval of both option and stock/index data for analysis.

## 2.2. Intraday & Daily Data Management
### 2.2.1. Timeframe Support
- **2.2.1.1.** The System shall support both **intraday and daily data retrieval** for options and underlying assets.
- **2.2.1.2.** The System shall ensure proper granularity for each dataset according to the timeframe selected.

### 2.2.2. Data Merging & Synchronization
- **2.2.2.1.** The System shall allow merging of daily and intraday datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **2.2.2.2.** The System shall prevent data inconsistencies when merging new data with previously stored records.

# 3. Data Integrity & Optimization
## 3.1. Performance Optimization
### 3.1.1. Request Efficiency
- **3.1.1.1.** The System shall optimize the request process to minimize API calls while ensuring full dataset coverage.
- **3.1.1.2.** The System shall process only missing data rather than re-downloading entire datasets.

## 3.2. Data Validation
### 3.2.1. Consistency Checks
- **3.2.1.1.** The System shall ensure that Greeks, IV, and OI values are mapped correctly to their corresponding options.
- **3.2.1.2.** The System shall validate option expiration dates to ensure accurate dataset retrieval.
- **3.2.1.3.** The System shall enforce a strict structure to prevent data mismatches.

# 4. Error Handling & Logging
## 4.1. API Error Management
### 4.1.1. Error Detection & Logging
- **4.1.1.1.** The System shall detect and log API errors, including **permission issues**, and provide meaningful error messages.
- **4.1.1.2.** The System shall capture and display the full HTTP response text before raising exceptions.
- **4.1.1.3.** The System shall handle "Insufficient permissions" errors by identifying restricted data and preventing repeated failed requests.

---

# 5. Theta Terminal Management
## 5.1. Independent Execution
### 5.1.1. Standalone Operation
- **5.1.1.1.** The System shall support independent execution of the Theta Terminal.
- **5.1.1.2.** The System shall allow launching the Theta Terminal separately from the data fetcher.
- **5.1.1.3.** The System shall ensure that the Theta Terminal operates without interfering with scheduled data updates.
